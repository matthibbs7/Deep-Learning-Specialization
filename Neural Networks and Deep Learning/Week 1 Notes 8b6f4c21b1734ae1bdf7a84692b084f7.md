# Week 1 Notes

### Supervised Learning

- Features an Input(x) and an Output(y)
- A couple examples:
    - Audio → text transcript
    - Ad, user info → Did they click the ad? (0/1)
    - English → Chinese
    - Image, Radar Info → Position of other cars

- Structured Data
    - Databases of data, with columns that tells us about features
- Unstructured Data
    - Raw audio, images, or simple text. Harder for computers to make sense of unstructured data

### Why is Deep Learning taking off?

- Went from having a **small** amount of data → a **large** amount of data
    - Activities on devices creates data

- (**m)** denotes the size of training set or number of examples
- Combination of Data, Computation, and Algorithm development progress
    - RELU function learns parameters must faster than the sigmoid function
